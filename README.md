# Roboshot

I created the Roboshot Tool while I was working in Accenture and there was a need in our team when testers required a utility tool which could ease their efforts of taking tons of sequential screenshorts for all test steps. This helped in reducing their efforts by 30%. As a click of the button keeps the screenshot in the memory and later, once the user is done, all the captured screenshots can be documented in a single document.

Steps for using the code:
- Import the project(present in the source code folder) in your eclipse.
- Set java facet as jdk1.6 or higher. 
- All jars are automatically imported so you dont need to do anything else.

Please read Roboshot.pptx to understand the use of the tool.
